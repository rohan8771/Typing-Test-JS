This is a small typing test application created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The idea of converting the quote string's letters into spans and then adding corresponding 'correct' or 'wrong' classes to them for color coding I got from Kyle from Web Dev Simplified in his video "Build A Speed Typing Game With JavaScript - Tutorial". 
The entire code was written by myself. I am hoping to add many additional functionalities with time. 

New functionalities added:
-> A WPM calculator that calculates and renders WPM every 2 seconds
-> A car which goes to the right as you type correctly. If you type wrong, it stops at the location where you made the first error (like in TypeRacer)
-> A button which upon finishing the quote shows details about the quote

Functionalities that I hope to add soon:
-> A log-in mechanism for users. Each user can see their say 5 most recent WPMs and their all-time average WPM. 
-> A mechanism to choose which car will be displayed.
